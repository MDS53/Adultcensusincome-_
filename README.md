## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the Adult Census Income dataset, which is publicly available and often used for classification tasks. It contains various demographic features of individuals such as age, education, marital status, occupation, etc., along with the target variable indicating whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually.

## Approach Overview

### Handling Missing Values

The dataset contains many missing values, which could potentially affect the performance of the machine learning models. To handle these missing values, a novel approach was adopted. Instead of imputing missing values or dropping records with missing values, an algorithm was used to handle them.

Since using the normal mode of handling missing values could lead to an imbalanced dataset, it was decided to split the dataset into training and testing sets based on the presence of missing values. Records with missing values were kept aside for testing, while records with non-missing values were used for training the models.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the dataset, understand the distributions of features, identify patterns, and detect outliers. Various statistical methods and visualizations were used to explore the data and understand its characteristics.

### Feature Engineering

Feature engineering plays a crucial role in building effective machine learning models. In this project, feature engineering techniques such as one-hot encoding were applied to categorical variables. The `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline` were used to efficiently preprocess the data and incorporate feature engineering into the machine learning pipeline.

### Model Building

Several machine learning algorithms were applied to build predictive models for the task of income prediction. The following algorithms were used:

- DecisionTreeClassifier
- LogisticRegression
- CatBoostClassifier
- XGBClassifier
- RandomForestClassifier

## Results

After evaluating the performance of each model, it was found that the CatBoostClassifier achieved the highest accuracy of 0.8732725969904801 on the test dataset. This accuracy score indicates how well the model predicts whether an individual earns more than $50,000 annually based on the given features.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates an approach to predict adult census income using machine learning algorithms while effectively handling missing values and incorporating feature engineering techniques. The CatBoostClassifier emerged as the best-performing model, achieving a high accuracy score on the test dataset. The code and documentation provided here can serve as a reference for similar classification tasks involving demographic data.
